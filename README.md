# RPG System in C++

This project is a simple turn-based RPG system that helps demonstrate basic object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It includes player and enemy characters with different stats, and a battle system where they take turns attacking until one wins. The code uses inheritance to create different types of characters, and polymorphism to allow them to share common behaviors.
